### 🎭 THE MISSION
This is part of the **Poetry Through Play** series. As a poet, gamer, and music lover, I questioned the possibility of obtaining meaningful connection through shared gameplay. The answers reside deep in this repository. 

Each contemporary haiku in this collection surfaced after a virtual performance. The songs that accompanied them made me constantly reevaluate my evolving relationship with life and music, bringing new words to the back of my lips. Each shot in this collection preserves a **momentary time blip**—an instance where indelible threads encapsulated the digital and physical world.
