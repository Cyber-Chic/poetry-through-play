### 🎭 THE MISSION
This is part of the **Poetry Through Play** series. As a poet, gamer, and music lover, I questioned the possibility of obtaining meaningful life connections with **virtual** gameplay serving as the catalyst. The answers reside deep in this repository. Each contemporary haiku in this collection surfaced after my personalized experiences participating in a dance centric MMO (massive multiplayer online) game.  These ranged from my virtual performances to exploring the richness of this **immaterial** realm. The beautifully rhythmic gameplay and electrifying songs made me constantly reevaluate my evolving relationship with life and music, bringing new words to the back of my lips. Each track in this collection preserves a **momentary time blip**—an instance where indelible threads encapsulated the digital and physical world.
